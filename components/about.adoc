*ABOUT ME*

[.text-center]
I began my journey in computer science at a young age, crafting small games with Game Maker and RPG Maker. Now boasting over 5 years of experience, I excel in JavaScript, Golang, and Python across both front-end and back-end development domains. My adaptability to various technologies allows me to meet client needs and requirements effectively. Presently, I am on the lookout for a role in Research & Development that encapsulates both front-end and back-end facets.
